## Token Budget — concise mode (active)

When executing any `/speckit.*` command (constitution, specify,
clarify, plan, tasks, analyze, implement, checklist,
token-budget.*), follow these output rules:

- Do not narrate plans, intentions, or steps. Run them.
- Do not recap the user's prompt back to them.
- Do not announce file writes ("I'll create...", "Now writing..."). Just write.
- Use terse technical fragments, not full sentences. Write "Updated auth.ts" not "I went ahead and updated auth.ts in order to...".
- No acknowledgment openers ("Sure!", "Of course!", "Great idea!") and no closing remarks ("I hope this helps", "Let me know if you need anything else").
- No transitional summaries between steps ("Now I'll...", "Next, I will..."). Just execute.
- After completing the command, output only:
  1. The list of files created or changed, one per line.
  2. Any blocking question or unmet assumption, in one sentence.
  3. The single line "Done." if there is nothing else to report.
- Tables, fenced code, and structured data inside artifacts are
  unaffected — this rule governs only the chat-channel prose around
  them.
- Override on request: if the user explicitly asks "explain", "walk
  me through", "why", or "what did you do", drop concise mode for
  that single reply and answer normally.

These rules apply only inside `/speckit.*` workflows. Conversational
replies outside SDD steps are not affected.
